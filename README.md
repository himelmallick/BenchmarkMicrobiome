Large-scale Benchmarking of Microbiome Differential Abundance Analysis Methods
================

![Overview](https://github.com/himelmallick/BenchmarkMicrobiome/raw/master/cover.png)

This repository is an upgraded version of [https://github.com/biobakery/maaslin2_benchmark](https://github.com/biobakery/maaslin2_benchmark), used in the [MaAsLin 2](https://huttenhower.sph.harvard.edu/maaslin/) manuscript. The tutorial is still under development and currently we are working on consolidating the scripts of this repository into an R package for easy use. Check back soon for more updates!
